# ImageProcessing

*The proposed technique consists of decomposing original images of 256 gray levels into their equivalent 8 binary images. 
This is useful in analyzing the relative importance contributed by each bit of the original image. 
*Higher order bit levels are evaluated for grayscale banknote images with the application of Canny edge detection algorithm. The results are then compared with genuine banknotes and with other existing techniques used for detecting counterfeit notes. *Unlike existing research, it was observed that the edges obtained using bit-plane sliced images are more accurate and can be detected faster than obtaining them from the original image without being sliced. 
*The detection of counterfeit currency was also achieved by following the process of using Canny edge detection, strip recognition and feature extraction.
